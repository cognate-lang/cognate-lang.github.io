~~ Fizzbuzz in Cognate

Def Fizzbuzz (
	Let N be Of (Integer?);
	Def Multiple as (Zero? Modulo Swap N);

    If Multiple of 15 then "fizzbuzz"

<p>Cognate is a project aiming to create a human readable programming language with as little syntax as possible. Where natural language programming usually uses many complex syntax rules, instead Cognate takes them away. What it adds is simple, a way to embed comments into statements.</p>
<!--cognate--><div class="code"><pre><code>
~~ Towers of Hanoi in Cognate

Def Move discs as (

   Let N be number of discs;
   Let A be first rod;
   Let B be second rod;
   Let C be third rod;

   Unless Zero? N (
      Move - 1 N discs from A via C to B;
      Prints ("Move disc " N " from " A " to " C);
      Move - 1 N discs from B via A to C;
   )
);

Move 5 discs from "a" via "b" to "c";
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, Cognate ignores words starting with lowercase letters, allowing them to be used to describe functionality and enhance readability. This makes Cognate codebases intuitive and maintainable.</p>
<!--cognate--><div class="code"><pre><code>
~~ Square numbers in Cognate

Def Square as (* Twin);
Map (Square) over Range 1 to 10;
Print;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Cognate is a stack-oriented programming language similar to Forth or Factor, except statements are evaluated right to left. This gives the expressiveness of concatenative programming as well as the readability of prefix notation. Statements can be delimited at arbitrary points, allowing them to read as sentences would in English.</p>
<!--cognate--><div class="code"><pre><code>
~~ Prime numbers in Cognate

Def Factor (Zero? Modulo Swap);

Def Primes (
	Fold (
        Let I be our potential prime;
		Let Primes are the found primes;
		Let To-check be Take-while (<= Sqrt I) Primes;
		When None (Factor of I) To-check
			(Append List (I)) to Primes;
	) from List () over Range from 2
);

Print Primes up to 1000;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Cognate borrows from other concatenative languages, but also adds unique features of its own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Point-free functions</li>
<li>Operation chaining</li>
<li>Multiple return values</li>
<li>Combinator oriented programming</li>
<li>Predicate pattern matching</li>
<li>Natural language programming</li>
</ul>
